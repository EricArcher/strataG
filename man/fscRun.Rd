\usage{
fscRun(p, num.sims = 1, dna.to.snp = FALSE, max.snps = NULL,
  all.sites = TRUE, inf.sites = FALSE, sfs.type = c("maf", "daf"),
  jobs = FALSE, nonpar.boot = NULL, no.arl.output = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{p}{list of fastsimcoal input parameters and output.}

\item{num.sims}{number of simulation replicates to run.}

\item{dna.to.snp}{convert DNA sequences to numerical SNPs?}

\item{max.snps}{maximum number of SNPs to retain.}

\item{all.sites}{retain all sites? If \code{FALSE}, only polymorphic DNA 
sites will be returned. This includes SNP blocks as they are simulated as 
DNA sequences.}

\item{inf.sites}{use infinite sites model? If \code{TRUE}, all mutations are 
retained in the output, thus the number of sites for SNPs or DNA sequences 
will potentially be greater than what was requested.}

\item{sfs.type}{type of site frequency spectrum to compute for each 
population sample: `daf` = derived allele frequency (unfolded), 
`maf` = minor allele frequency (folded).}

\item{jobs}{output one simulated or bootstrapped SFS per file in a 
separate directory?}

\item{nonpar.boot}{number of bootstraps to perform on polymorphic sites to
extract SFS.}

\item{no.arl.output}{do not output arlequin files.}

\item{maxlhood}{Perform parameter estimation by maximum composite 
likelihood from the SFS?}

\item{num.loops}{number of loops (ECM cycles) to be performed when 
estimating parameters from SFS. Default is 20.}

\item{min.num.loops}{number of loops (ECM cycles) for which the 
likelihood is computed on both monomorphic and polymorphic sites. Default 
is 20.}

\item{brent}{Tolerance level for Brent optimization.
Smaller value imply more precise estimations, but require more 
computation time. Default = 0.01. Value is restricted between 
1e-5 and 1e-1.}

\item{trees}{output NEXUS formatted coalescent trees for all replicates?}

\item{num.cores}{number of cores to use.}

\item{seed}{random number seed for simulation.}

\item{exec}{name of fastsimcoal executable.}

\item{label}{character string to label files with.}

\item{save.est}{do not delete .est parameter estimation files during cleanup?}

\description{
Run a fastsimcoal simulation and load results into a 
  \linkS4class{gtypes} object.
}
\note{
fastsimcoal is not included with `strataG` and must be downloaded 
  separately. Additionally, it must be installed such that it can be run from 
  the command line in the current working directory. See the vignette 
  for \code{external.programs} for installation instructions.
