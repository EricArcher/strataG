\title{Most Distant Sequences}
\usage{
mostDistantSequences(
  x,
  num.seqs = NULL,
  model = "raw",
  pairwise.deletion = TRUE,
  as.haplotypes = TRUE,
  simplify = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a set of sequences or a \linkS4class{gtypes} object with sequences.}

\item{num.seqs}{number of sequences to return. If \code{NULL} (default), all
sequences are returned from most to least distant.}

\item{model}{a character string specifying the evolutionary model to be used.
See \code{\link[ape]{dist.dna}} for more information.}

\item{pairwise.deletion}{a logical indicating whether to delete sites with
missing data. See \code{\link[ape]{dist.dna}} for more information.}

\item{as.haplotypes}{treat sequences as haplotypes (\code{TRUE}) or expand
haplotypes to one sequence per individual (\code{FALSE}). If the latter,
individual frequencies are used in cluster formation.}

\item{simplify}{if there is a single locus, return result in a simplified
form? If \code{FALSE} a list will be returned wth one element per locus.}
}
\value{
a vector of the \code{num.seqs} sequence names that are the most
  divergent sorted from greatest to least distant.
}
\description{
Finds the set of sequences that are on the edges of the cloud of
  distances. These are the ones that have the greatest mean pairwise distance
  and greatest variance in distances.
