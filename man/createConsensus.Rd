\title{Consensus Sequence}
\usage{
createConsensus(x, ignore.gaps = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \linkS4class{gtypes} object with aligned sequences or a list of 
aligned DNA sequences.}

\item{ignore.gaps}{logical. Ignore gaps at a site when creating consensus. 
If \code{TRUE}, then bases with a gap are removed before consensus is 
calculated. If \code{FALSE} and a gap is present, then the result is a gap.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the consensus sequence.
}
\description{
Return a consensus sequence from set of aligned sequences, 
  introducing IUPAC ambiguity codes where necessary.

\examples{
data(dolph.seqs)
createConsensus(dolph.seqs)
