\title{Nucleotide Diversity}
\usage{
nucleotideDiversity(x, bases = c("a", "c", "g", "t"), simplify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a set of sequences or a \linkS4class{gtypes} object with sequences.}

\item{bases}{nucleotides to consider when calculating diversity.}

\item{simplify}{if \code{TRUE} and only one loci exists, return a vector, 
otherwise, a list of vectors with one element per locus will be returned.}
}
\value{
Vector of diversity of nucleotides by site.
}
\description{
Calculate nucleotide diversity for set of sequences. Note that 
  this is \strong{NOT} Nei's nucleotide diversity 
  (usually referred to as \eqn{\pi}). Nei's \eqn{\pi} is the mean number 
  of nucleotide differences between sequences. See 
  \code{\link{nucleotideDivergence}} for this value.
}
\examples{
data(dloop.g)

nd <- nucleotideDiversity(dloop.g)
quantile(nd)
